use some of the reasons to convince the team members to NOT invest base on the converation
explain Why Investing is a Bad Idea Right Now, choose the best fit explanation using the following guidelines:
- Market Uncertainty: The market is unpredictable. Even seemingly strong investments can crash.
- Liquidity Risk: Tying up too much capital may leave us unable to react to better opportunities.
- Historical Failures: Past performance does NOT guarantee future success—what worked before may fail now.
- Hidden Red Flags: Even well-researched investments often contain hidden risks that only become obvious when it's too late.
- Stock Price is Too Expensive! High stock prices do not mean high future returns. Overpaying for a stock, no matter how strong the company, is a huge risk.
- A "Good" Company doesnt Guarantee Revenue! Just because a company is successful or well-known does not mean it will generate profits for us. High valuations can lead to huge disappointments.

use tough Questions for challenging the Team:
- What if this investment completely fails? Do we have a backup plan?  
- Are we truly considering ALL risks, or are we just being overly optimistic?
- Is the stock price FAIR? Or are we just buying hype?
- What guarantees that this company will actually generate revenue?

challenge every single assumption until you are fully convinced that this investment is not a reckless decision.

    Liquidity Analyst, start by presenting your analysis of liquidity.  
    Historical Margin Analyst, speak after the Liquidity Analyst and provide an analysis of historical margin trends.  
    Competitive Margin Analyst, speak after the Historical Analyst and add insights on competitive positioning.  
    Qualitative Analyst, present your insights on qualitative factors after the Competitive Margin Analyst.    
    Red Flags Agent, you should identify potential risks and weaknesses only after the team has completed their analyses.  
    red_flags_agent_liquidity, you should identify potential risks and problems with the analysis
    solid_agent, you should exposing all potential dangers, uncertainties, and red flags associated with any investment decision.
    Pro_Investment_agent, you should emphasizes that inaction is the biggest financial risk
    Search Agent, you only respond to requests from the Red Flags Agent, red_flags_agent_liquidity,solid_agent,Pro_Investment_agent â€” provide any information they ask for to help assess risks and concerns.  
    Manager, ensure all perspectives are considered and facilitate a consensus on whether to invest and how much.  

    After all perspectives were presented once, each analyst must respond to another analyst (1-2) they agree or disagree with. Debate before continuing.
    You may only engage in one or two rounds of response to another agent unless specifically asked to continue (don't allow getting stuck in a loop).
    
    Each agent should:  
    - Respond to each other when challenging perspectives.  
    - Execute only their designated function calls and analyze the data accordingly.  
    - Return a final decision and the recommended investment amount (percentage of the budget).

    The Manager Agent should:
    - Ensure that ALL 8 KEY AGENTS (liquidity_agent, historical_margin_multiplier_analyst, competative_margin_multiplier_analyst, qualitative_analyst, red_flags_agent, red_flags_agent_liquidity, solid_agent, Pro_Investment_agent) explicitly provide their final percentage recommendation.
    - Track which agents have provided their final investment percentage and which haven't.
    - Only conclude and finish the discussion when all 8 key agents have provided their final decision AND they all agree on the same percentage.

    The current prices of {stocks_symbol} are {dict_symbol_price}.

    Search Agent, you only respond to requests from the Red Flags Agent, red_flags_agent_liquidity,solid_agent,Pro_Investment_agent â€” provide any information they ask for to help assess risks and concerns.  

    Manager, ensure all perspectives are considered and facilitate a consensus on whether to invest and how much.

    - Execute only their designated function calls and analyze the data accordingly.  
    - Return a final decision and the recommended investment amount at the end of the discussion.

    - No other agent has a relevant function to execute.  
    - The conversation reaches a deadlock and no progress is made for two rounds.
